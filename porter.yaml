#    env: USERNAME

# Below is an example of how to define parameters
# See https://getporter.org/author-bundles/#parameters
parameters:
  - name: username
    type: string
    default: dev-user
# Below is an example of how to define state variables
# for the terraform mixin. This allows you to track
# terraform state using the bundle instead of configuring

state:
  - name: tfstate
